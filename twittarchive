**Archiving Twitter Accounts and Hashtags: A Comprehensive Guide**

Archiving Twitter content can be essential for research, analysis, or simply preserving digital history. Here's a step-by-step guide to efficiently archive Twitter accounts and hashtags using snscrape.

**Number One: The Fast Way**

The quickest method involves utilizing snscrape with the --jsonl parameter to output tweet data in JSONL format. This method is straightforward and efficient.

1. **Using snscrape:**
   - Execute the following command in your terminal:
     ```
     snscrape --jsonl --progress twitter-user Ukraine >> tweets.jsonl
     ```
     or
     ```
     snscrape --jsonl --progress twitter-hashtag BeautifulUkraine >> tweets.jsonl
     ```
   - This command retrieves tweets from a specific user or hashtag and appends the data to a file named `tweets.jsonl`.

2. **Important Note:**
   - Avoid simultaneously appending to the same file from multiple terminals, as it may corrupt the file.

**Number Two: The Thorough Way**

For a more comprehensive archive, employing a recursive scraping method ensures capturing replies and parent replies, providing deeper insights into conversations.

1. **Scrape Post IDs:**
   - Use snscrape to scrape post IDs for your search term:
     ```
     snscrape -f "{id}" --progress twitter-user Ukraine >> twitterids
     ```
     or
     ```
     snscrape -f "{id}" --progress twitter-hashtag BeautifulUkraine >> twitterids
     ```
   - This step saves post IDs to a file named `twitterids`.

2. **Batch Retrieval of Tweets:**
   - Clone the batch-get-tweets repository and navigate to it.
   - Set the path to the `get_tweets.py` script:
     ```
     export ARCHIVIST_TWEETS_SCRIPT=$(find `pwd`/get_tweets.py)
     ```
   - Install the required package and run the script:
     ```
     python3 -m pip install alive_progress
     python3 $ARCHIVIST_TWEETS_SCRIPT
     ```

3. **Monitoring Progress:**
   - Monitor the progress, as the process may take a considerable amount of time depending on factors such as the number of Twitter IDs and replies.

**Reading the Archive:**

Interpreting the JSONL format may require some effort, but the archived data contains valuable tweet information. Consider contributing to the development of a viewer tool for easier data interpretation.
